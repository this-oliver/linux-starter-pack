# Linux Starter Pack

> My lawyer told me to write this: **Use at your own risk!**

Imagine you have a brand new Linux machine or you want to reinstall your OS or you kinda messed up your system, but you want to have your old setup back.

This project offers an **opinionated** set of scripts to install and configure a set of tools on a fresh Linux system... primarily for development purposes.

The scripts provide the following features:

- install basic tools (i.e. `git`, `curl`, `bat` and `nmap`)
- setup docker
- setup oh-my-zsh
- setup nodejs

## Usage

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/this-oliver/linux-starter-pack.git

# change into the directory
cd linux-starter-pack

# make the script executable
chmod +x install.sh

# run the script
./install.sh
```
